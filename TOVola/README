Note          : This code uses GSL as the heart ODE solver 
		and uses GRHayLib thorn to store EOS data.

==========
1. Purpose
==========

TOVola is an Einstein Toolkit thorn that solves the TOV equations, or the equations 
of hydrostatic equilibrium for spherically symmetric static stars, specifically 
Neutron stars. It was designed for straightforward use and allow for multiple
types of EOS.

==========
2. Support
==========

TOVola supports three types of EOS: Simple Polytrope, Piecewise Polytrope, 
and Tabulated EOS.

At this time, TOVola only allows two adaptive ODE methods from GSL: 
RK4(5) and DP7(8). GSL allows for more methods, both adaptive and non-adaptive, 
but the two I listed felt sufficient enough.

All these choices can be made in the parfile. No touching the src code is
necessary (as it should be). For examples of using each EOS type, see the par directory,
or the "Compatible Equations of State" section in the documentation.

3. Testing
==========

This code has been tested against both the NRpy generated TOV solver and 
constraint tested using Baikal.

Simple Polytrope: 
Raw data sits within 10^-12/-13 in relative error with NRpy
Constraint violation tested with Baikal

Piecewise Polytrope:
Raw data sits within 10^-12/-13 in relative error with NRpy
Constraint violation tested with Baikal

Tabulated EOS:
Raw data sits within 10^-8 in relative error with NRpy (Mostly from EOS table interpolation)
Constraint violation tested with Baikal
